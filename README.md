# Bank Account Fraud Detection - Erdős Bootcamp  

## 👥 Our Team  
We are a team of ** ? ** participants in the **Erdős Bootcamp**, working on the **Bank Account Fraud (BAF) Kaggle competition**. Our goal is to develop fair, explainable, and effective ML models for fraud detection, tackling challenges such as **class imbalance, bias, and temporal shifts**.  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This repository contains our work for the **Bank Account Fraud (BAF) Kaggle competition**, which is based on the **NeurIPS 2022 BAF dataset**. The competition provides a **realistic, privacy-preserving, and imbalanced** fraud detection dataset.  

## 📌 Dataset  
The **BAF dataset** consists of **six synthetic tabular datasets** designed to simulate real-world fraud detection scenarios. It features:  
- **Extremely imbalanced data** with a low prevalence of fraud cases.  
- **Controlled biases** across different datasets.  
- **Temporal aspects** with observed distribution shifts.  
- **Privacy-preserving features**, including **differential privacy techniques** and a **CTGAN-generated dataset**.  

For more details, check out the [official Kaggle competition page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sgpjesus/bank-account-fraud-dataset-neurips-2022?select=Base.csv).  

## 📊 Objective  
The primary objective is to build **fair, explainable, and effective ML models** for fraud detection. The key challenges include:  
- Handling extreme **class imbalance**.  
- Mitigating dataset **bias** for fairness-aware ML.  
- Adapting models to **temporal distribution shifts**.  

## 🏗️ Project Structure  

## 🔥 Models & Techniques  
The following **machine learning approaches** will be explored:  
- **Baseline Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees  
- **Advanced Models**: XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest , Bayesian model 
 

## 📈 Evaluation Metric  
Given the dataset's extreme class imbalance, traditional accuracy is not meaningful. Instead, the competition recommends:  
- **Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC)**  
- **F1-Score and Recall** for fraud detection  


 ## Stakeholders

This project is valuable to multiple stakeholders, including:

- **Financial Institutions & Banks**: To improve fraud detection and reduce financial losses.
- **Credit Card Companies**: To prevent fraudulent transactions and enhance security.
- **Consumers**: To protect customers from unauthorized transactions and fraudulent charges.
- **Data Scientists & Machine Learning Engineers**: To develop and refine models for fraud detection.
- **Regulatory Agencies**: To ensure compliance with financial fraud prevention standards.
